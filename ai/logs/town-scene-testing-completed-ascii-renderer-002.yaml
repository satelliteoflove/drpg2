outcome: |
  Successfully validated TownScene ASCII rendering implementation. The feature flag system
  works correctly, allowing runtime toggling between original and ASCII rendering modes.
  The ASCII grid properly initializes with 80x25 dimensions and renders town menu options.
  Canvas dimensions are preserved and the system maintains good performance.
manual_test_instructions: |
  1. Start the development server with 'npm run dev'
  2. Open http://localhost:8080/test-ascii-renderer.html in browser
  3. Click "Enable ASCII Mode" button
  4. Verify status shows "ASCII Mode: ENABLED"
  5. Open browser console and run: window.FeatureFlags.enable('ascii_town_scene')
  6. Navigate to main game at http://localhost:8080
  7. Verify "[ASCII MODE]" appears in town title
  8. Test menu navigation with arrow keys
  9. Run: window.FeatureFlags.disable('ascii_town_scene')
  10. Verify scene returns to original rendering
surprises_or_notes: |
  - The renderLayered method is used instead of render() for TownScene
  - Canvas should NOT be resized when ASCII mode is enabled
  - ASCII content is rendered as visual graphics, not raw text
suggested_follow_ups:
  - Complete ShopScene ASCII migration
  - Add automated tests using Jest
  - Implement keyboard navigation for menu items
  - Add visual feedback for selected menu items
reimplementation_prompt: |
  Test the TownScene ASCII rendering implementation for a Wizardry-like game.
  
  Requirements:
  - Verify feature flag toggle works (window.FeatureFlags.enable/disable)
  - Ensure ASCII grid initializes with 80x25 dimensions
  - Check that canvas dimensions are preserved (not resized)
  - Validate menu options are rendered in ASCII mode
  - Test dynamic switching between rendering modes at runtime
  - Confirm "[ASCII MODE]" indicator appears in title
  
  The TownScene should check feature flags dynamically in renderLayered() method,
  not just at construction time. ASCII state renders to canvas as visual graphics.
