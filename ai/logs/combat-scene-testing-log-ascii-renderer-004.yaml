      CombatScene has partial ASCII integration:
      - ASCII state is initialized (lines 46-59)
      - Update method syncs state (lines 170-174)
      - Render method shows ASCII when enabled (lines 177-207)
      - Input handling partially delegates to ASCII (lines 401-420)
      - However, action execution doesn't properly flow back from ASCII to main scene

      The executeAction method in CombatASCIIState doesn't actually trigger
      combat actions - it just logs them. Need to fix bidirectional communication.

      Implemented bidirectional sync between CombatScene and CombatASCIIState:
      - Added syncFromASCII() and syncToASCII() methods
      - Added pendingAction tracking in ASCII state
      - Modified executeAction to properly queue actions
      - Updated all sync points in enter(), update(), and handleInput()

    content: Created Playwright tests for CombatScene ASCII rendering

    type: problem-encountered
    content: |
      Tests are unable to trigger combat naturally through dungeon movement.
      Created basic tests that force switch to combat scene directly.
      Tests show combat scene can be initialized but scene switching needs
      to be triggered through actual game mechanics.

    type: workaround
    content: |
      Created combat-ascii-basic.test.js that directly switches to combat scene
      for testing purposes. This allows testing of ASCII rendering in combat
      without relying on triggering combat through dungeon exploration.
