      DungeonScene is the most complex scene due to:
      - First-person 3D-like dungeon view
      - Multiple UI overlays (map, status panel, message log)
      - Dynamic tile rendering based on visibility
      - Movement and interaction systems
      - Debug overlay integration

      Playwright test results (7 of 10 passing):
      ✓ ASCII mode initialization and grid rendering
      ✓ Mini-map display
      ✓ Full map toggle functionality
      ✓ Control hints display
      ✓ ASCII/Canvas mode switching
      ✓ Special tile rendering
      ✓ Performance benchmarks (< 50ms average render time)
      - Party status panel rendering (minor issue)
      - Message log display (timing issue)
      - Movement handling (input delay issue)
