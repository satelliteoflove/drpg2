# Wizardry Gaiden IV: Spell Learning System

## Overview
In Wizardry Gaiden IV, characters learn spells automatically as they gain levels. The rate of spell acquisition varies significantly by class, with pure spellcasters learning faster than hybrid classes.

## Spell Schools
The game features four distinct schools of magic:
- **Mage**: Arcane offensive and utility magic
- **Priest**: Divine healing and support magic
- **Alchemist**: Alchemical transmutation and elemental magic
- **Psionic**: Mental and psychic abilities

## Spell Learning by Class

### Pure Spellcasters
These classes learn spells at the fastest rate, gaining access to new spell levels every 2 character levels on average.

| Spell Level | Mage | Priest | Alchemist | Psionic |
|-------------|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Level 1     | 1    | 1      | 1         | 1       |
| Level 2     | 3    | 3      | 3         | 3       |
| Level 3     | 5    | 5      | 5         | 5       |
