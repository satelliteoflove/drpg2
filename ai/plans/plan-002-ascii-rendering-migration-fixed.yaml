notes: |
  Major milestones achieved:
  - DungeonScene fully working with ASCII rendering (10/10 tests passing)
  - TownScene fully integrated with ASCII rendering (3/3 tests passing)
  - Scene transitions working correctly (Town ↔ Shop ↔ Dungeon)
  - Feature flag system working dynamically for runtime toggling
  - Performance targets met (60 FPS, <50ms render time)
  
  Remaining work:
  1. Complete CombatScene ASCII integration (state exists, partial integration)
  2. Complete ShopScene ASCII integration (state exists, not integrated)
  3. Create InventoryScene ASCII state and integration
  4. Implement save/load functionality with ASCII state
  
  Technical achievements:
  - Bidirectional sync between Scene and ASCII state
  - Dynamic feature flag toggling without memory leaks
  - Comprehensive Playwright test coverage
  
  Technical debt:
  - ASCIIDebugger disabled (.bak file) - needs interface refactoring
  - Jest tests moved to backup folder - fully replaced by Playwright
  - Selection persistence when enabling ASCII mid-session could be improved
