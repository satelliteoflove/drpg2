  Successfully migrated TownScene to support ASCII rendering while maintaining backward compatibility.
  Created TownASCIIState class that extends BaseASCIIScene with full town layout and menu system.
  Integrated feature flag system to toggle between standard and ASCII rendering modes.
  All existing functionality preserved with new ASCII visualization option.
manual_test_instructions: |
  1. Start the development server with npm run dev
  2. Open browser console and enable ASCII town: window.FeatureFlags.enable('ascii_town_scene')
  3. Navigate to the town scene
  4. Verify ASCII art displays town buildings and menu
  5. Test keyboard navigation with arrow keys
  6. Press Enter to select menu options
  7. Press ESC to return to dungeon
  8. Disable flag to test standard rendering: window.FeatureFlags.disable('ascii_town_scene')
  9. Run tests: npm test src/scenes/__tests__/TownScene.test.ts
surprises_or_notes: |
  The implementation required creating a bridge between the existing key input system and the 
  ASCII state's KeyboardEvent-based input. Created a key conversion utility to handle this.
  The ASCII art representation provides a more immersive text-based experience while maintaining
  all original functionality.
suggested_follow_ups:
  - Enhance ASCII art with more detailed building representations
  - Add animation effects for menu selection
  - Implement hover effects for mouse support
  - Add sound effects for menu navigation
