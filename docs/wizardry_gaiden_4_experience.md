# Wizardry Gaiden IV: Experience System

## Overview
The experience point (XP) system in Wizardry Gaiden IV determines character progression and leveling. Experience requirements vary significantly based on both character race and class, creating unique progression curves for different character combinations.

## Experience Modifiers

### Race and Class Matrix
Each race/class combination has a unique experience modifier that affects how much XP is needed to advance levels. This creates strategic choices during character creation.

*Actual XP required = Base XP Ã— Race/Class Modifier*

## Experience Gain

### Combat Experience
- Experience is awarded for defeating monsters
- XP is divided equally among all living party members
- Bonus XP for defeating monsters above party level
- Reduced XP for defeating monsters below party level

### Special Experience Sources
- Quest completion rewards
- First-time area discovery bonuses
- Treasure chest bonuses
- Special event rewards

### Experience Penalties
- Characters who flee from combat receive no experience
- Dead characters receive no experience until resurrected
- Petrified or otherwise incapacitated characters receive reduced experience

## Level Advancement

### Level-Up Process
1. Character must have sufficient XP for next level
2. Character must rest at an inn or training ground
3. Hit points increase based on class and vitality
4. Spell points increase for spellcasting classes
5. Chance for attribute increases
6. New spells learned at appropriate levels

### Multi-Classing
- Characters can change class after meeting requirements
- XP is reset to 0 for the new class
- Previous class abilities are retained but limited
- Level is reset to 1 in the new class

## Strategic Considerations

### Optimal Race/Class Combinations
- **Faerie Mage**: 0.8 modifier - fastest leveling mage
- **Dwarf Fighter**: 0.9 modifier - strong, fast-leveling warrior
- **Gnome Priest**: 0.8 modifier - fastest leveling priest
- **Hobbit Thief**: 0.8 modifier - ideal thief choice
- **Lizman Fighter**: 0.8 modifier - powerful and fast-leveling

### Slow Progression Combinations
- **Faerie Samurai/Lord**: 1.6 modifier - extremely slow
- **Most Ninja combinations**: 1.3-1.5 modifier - slowest class overall
- **Elite classes generally**: Higher modifiers across the board

## Notes
- Experience requirements increase exponentially at higher levels
- The modifier system encourages playing races in their "natural" classes
- Elite classes (Samurai, Lord, Ninja, etc.) always require more XP regardless of race
- Some race/class combinations are intentionally suboptimal to reflect lore constraints
