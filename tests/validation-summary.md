Date: 2025-09-11
Status: ✅ PASSED

## Automated Test Results

### System Stability
- ✅ Application loads without errors
- ✅ No runtime errors detected
- ✅ Canvas rendering functional
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors

### Feature Flag System
- ✅ Feature flags can be read from localStorage
- ✅ ASCII feature flag can be toggled
- ✅ No errors when ASCII flag is enabled (rendering disabled)

### Component Status

- ✅ Hot module replacement functional

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Playwright automated tests
node tests/validation-checkpoint.test.js

# TypeScript compilation check
npm run typecheck

# Documentation verification
ls -la docs/validation-report.md docs/lessons-learned.md
```

## Validation Conclusion

The system has been successfully stabilized with:
1. Zero compilation errors
2. Stable runtime execution
3. Comprehensive documentation of the stabilization process
4. Clear path forward for re-enabling ASCII features

The validation checkpoint is **COMPLETE** and the system is ready for the next phase of development.
