outcome: |
  Successfully validated the stabilized ASCII rendering system and documented the current state.
  
  Key achievements:
  - System now compiles with 0 TypeScript errors
  - Comprehensive validation report created documenting stabilization
  - Lessons learned updated with critical insights from error resolution
  - Clear path forward identified with interface standardization priority
  
  The system is stable and ready for controlled re-implementation of ASCII features.
manual_test_instructions: |
  1. Start the dev server with 'npm run dev'
  2. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
  3. Open browser console and verify no runtime errors
  4. Check that the game loads and displays the Town scene
  5. Open DevTools and check localStorage for feature flags
  6. Toggle ASCII feature flags in console:
     localStorage.setItem('feature_flag_ASCII_TOWN_SCENE', 'true')
  7. Refresh and verify no errors (ASCII currently disabled)
  8. Review validation report at docs/validation-report.md
  9. Review lessons learned at docs/lessons-learned.md
surprises_or_notes: |
  The stabilization phase revealed deeper architectural issues than initially apparent:
  - ASCIIState vs ASCIIGrid confusion needs resolution before proceeding
  - Method naming inconsistencies were more widespread than expected
  - Test isolation proved critical for maintaining development velocity
  
  The decision to temporarily disable ASCII features was correct and enabled clean compilation.
suggested_follow_ups:
  - Resolve ASCIIState architecture (composition vs inheritance)
  - Standardize method naming conventions across all ASCII components
  - Re-enable TownScene ASCII rendering with corrected interfaces
  - Fix ASCIIDebugger to work with standardized interfaces
  - Create TypeScript definition files for ASCII system
  - Restore and update test suite after interface stabilization
reimplementation_prompt: |
  Validate and document the state of an ASCII rendering system after stabilization.
  
  Context:
  - System had 40+ TypeScript compilation errors
  - ASCII features were temporarily disabled to achieve stability
  - Now has 0 compilation errors and stable foundation
  
  Tasks:
  1. Update validation report with current system state
  2. Document lessons learned from stabilization phase
  3. Identify architectural decisions needed before proceeding
  4. Create clear recommendations for next steps
  5. Document technical debt and repayment plan
  
  Focus on providing actionable insights and clear path forward for re-enabling ASCII features.
