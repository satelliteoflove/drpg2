  Successfully created race configuration files for all 11 WGIV races with accurate stat ranges:
  - Created RaceConfig interface with StatRange and RaceStats types
  - Implemented configuration files for all races with min/max stat values
  - Created index.ts with RACES object and RACE_LIST array for easy access
  - All stat ranges match WGIV documentation exactly
manual_test_instructions: |
  1. Run: npm run typecheck
  2. Verify no compilation errors
  3. Run: npm run dev
  4. Create new characters and verify stat ranges match race specifications
  5. Check that Faerie characters have Strength 5-15, Agility 14-24
  6. Check that Lizman characters have Vitality 14-24, Intelligence 5-15
surprises_or_notes: |
  Stat ranges vary dramatically between races, creating distinct playstyles.
  Some combinations make certain class/race pairs very difficult to roll.
reimplementation_prompt: |
  Create race configuration files for a WGIV character system with stat ranges.
  Each race has specific min/max values for the 6 stats (ST, IQ, PI, VT, AG, LK).
  Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety and create individual files per race.
