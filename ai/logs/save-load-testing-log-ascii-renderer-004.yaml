      Current save system saves GameState which includes:
      - party data
      - dungeon levels
      - current floor
      - combat state
      - game time
      - turn count
      But does NOT save ASCII-specific UI state like:
      - Selected menu options in scenes
      - Map visibility toggle in DungeonScene
      - Current view modes in various scenes

    type: decision

      ASCII state should be considered ephemeral UI state that doesn't need persistence.
      When loading a save, scenes will initialize with default ASCII state values.
      This approach keeps saves backward compatible and avoids save bloat.

    type: note
    content: |
      ASCII state persistence is not required for save/load functionality.
      The ASCII renderer feature flag is a runtime setting that can be toggled
      independently of game saves. When a save is loaded, ASCII state is
      recreated fresh based on the current feature flag setting.
