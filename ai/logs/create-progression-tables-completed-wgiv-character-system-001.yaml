  - Helper functions for XP calculations and spell availability checks
  - All data matches WGIV documentation exactly
manual_test_instructions: |
  1. Run: npm run typecheck
  2. Verify no compilation errors
  3. Run: npm run dev
  4. Create a Faerie Mage (0.8x modifier) and Faerie Samurai (1.6x modifier)
  5. Verify Faerie Mage levels faster than Faerie Samurai
  6. Check spell learning: Mage learns at 1,3,5,7... Bishop at 1,5,9,13...
surprises_or_notes: |
  Experience modifiers range from 0.8x to 1.6x based on race/class combination.
  Bishop has unique spell learning progression (slower than pure casters).
  Some optimal combinations: Hobbit Thief (0.8x), Lizman Fighter (0.8x).
