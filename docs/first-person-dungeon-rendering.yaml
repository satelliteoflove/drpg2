      In this tutorial, we will be going over some ways to create tiles for a faux 3D dungeon in the first-person perspective. This style is most recognizable from games like Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry, or Might and Magic.

      These types of games utilized a simulated first-person perspective by having textures that were drawn to specific angles. This could be done using pre-rendered 3D graphics, pixel art, or even ray casting. This type of game is also referred to as a "blobber", due to the way both the player and enemy parties move around the game world on a grid as singular units, or blobs. This is different from being able to control or move each character around the map individually.

      Before we begin, we need to break things down just a little bit. I would like to clarify some terminology I will be using throughout the tutorial.

      When talking about blobbers or first-person dungeon crawlers, it is important to understand how the entire dungeon is laid out on a grid. Each individual grid square is referred to as a CELL. The main dungeon view area is separated into multiple rows of CELLS called LAYERS, which display the dungeon TILES at varying sizes to create the illusion of perspective. A CELL is made up of several TILES, such as the ceiling, floor, or walls.

      The main difference between LAYERS and CELLS is that each LAYER is made up of a certain number of CELLS used to display the dungeon to the player. Whereas CELLS only represent a single room, or a single space on the grid, and are made up of individual TILES.
    terminology:
      - term: Tile
        definition: An individual wall, floor, or ceiling tile, used to compose Cells
      - term: Cell
        definition: Made up of Tiles to form a single room or hall and takes up one grid square
      - term: Layer
        definition: Made up of Cells to form a single depth-layer of the dungeon view area
    key_concepts:
      - concept: Layer sizing
        description: Each layer of the dungeon view is 1/2 the size of the layer above it
      - concept: Layer brightness
        description: Each layer is 1/2 the brightness of the layer above it
      - concept: Depth illusion
        description: This particular resizing and shading gives a really nice illusion of depth
      - concept: Cell division
        description: Layer 1 contains 3 cells (1,2,3), Layer 2 contains 5 cells (4,5,6,7,8), Layer 3 contains 9 cells

      First, we should start with something basic, like how to assemble some tiles together to form a room, or CELL. We only need five tiles to simulate the appearance of a hallway or a room!

      The basic construction of a pseudo-3D room uses several skewed textures with varying degrees of shading to simulate depth.
    tile_types:
      - name: Top Wall
        color: Green (in index mask)
      - name: Back Wall
        color: Blue (in index mask)
      - name: Left Wall
        color: Dark Grey (in index mask)
      - name: Right Wall
        color: Light Grey (in index mask)
      - name: Floor
        color: Red (in index mask)
    process:
      - step: 1
        action: Start with seamless texture
        details: Use a 512x512 texture (texture size becomes dungeon view size)
      - step: 2
        action: Create Back Wall
        details: Scale layer to 1/2 original size (512x512 → 256x256 centered)
      - step: 3
        action: Create Left Wall
        details: |
          - Paste full texture to new layer
          - Use Perspective tool
          - Shift upper right and lower right knobs 16 squares from left edge (aligns with Back Wall left edge)
          - Move bottom right knob up to Back Wall bottom edge
          - Move top right knob down to Back Wall top edge
      - step: 4
        action: Create Right Wall
        details: |
          - Paste full texture to new layer
          - Use Perspective tool
          - Shift upper left and lower left knobs 16 squares from right edge (aligns with Back Wall right edge)
          - Move bottom left knob up to Back Wall bottom edge
          - Move top left knob down to Back Wall top edge
      - step: 5
        action: Create Floor
        details: |
          - Paste full texture to new layer
          - Drag upper left and upper right knobs down to Back Wall bottom edge
          - Drag upper left and upper right knobs 16 squares from edges (align with Back Wall sides)
      - step: 6
        action: Create Top Wall
        details: Same as Floor but drag knobs up to Back Wall top edge instead

    title: Simple Shading
    content: |
      One thing we can do to give our scene a little bit more depth is to apply some brightness adjustments to our wall tiles. Since each tile is currently on its own unique layer, we can tweak each one separately.
    shading_values:
      - tile: Left Wall
        brightness_adjustment: -50
      - tile: Right Wall
        brightness_adjustment: -50
      - tile: Top Wall
        brightness_adjustment: -75
      - tile: Floor
        brightness_adjustment: "+25 to +50 (optional)"
        note: Can be left untouched
      - tile: Back Wall
        brightness_adjustment: Addressed in gradient shading section

    title: Gradient Shading
    content: |
      A more advanced shading technique uses gradients with the Grain Merge blend mode to create the appearance of light fading towards the back of the room.
    process:
      - step: 1
        action: Set foreground and background colors
        details: |
          Foreground Color (light gray):
            - R, G, B sliders: 25
            - Hue and Saturation: 0
            - Value: 25

          Background Color (lighter gray):
            - Divide foreground values by 2
      - step: 2
        action: Create gradient for Left Wall
        details: |
          - Create new layer above Left Wall layer
          - Set layer boundary size to 1/4 canvas width (512px → 128px)
          - Draw linear gradient from a few ticks from left edge to right side of Left Wall
          - Start about 16-32 pixels from edge
          - Change blend mode to Grain Merge
          - Merge down into Left Wall layer
      - step: 3
        action: Repeat for other walls
        details: |
          - Right Wall: gradient from right edge inward
          - Top Wall: gradient from top edge down
          - Floor: gradient from bottom edge up
          - Back Wall: gradient from any edge or bucket fill with foreground color
    key_technique:
      blend_mode: Grain Merge
      description: This blend mode gives the best results for this type of effect, allowing original texture brightness to show through while creating depth through shading

technical_notes:
  - note: Grid snapping
    details: Use 8x8 grid spacing for precise alignment
  - note: Texture size

  - note: Seamless textures
    details: Not required but recommended for best results
  - note: Alternative approach
    details: Can apply gradients before Perspective Transform
  - note: Layer system
    details: Each tile on separate layer allows individual tweaking
  - note: Vanishing point perspective
    details: Creates illusion with certain cells extending beyond viewable area

implementation_concepts:

  - concept: Depth-based shading
    description: Each layer is 50% darker than the previous
